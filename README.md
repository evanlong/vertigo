# Vertigo App

An easy way to record the vertigo effect with an iPhone

## Test Information

The app is hardcoded to only perform the "pull" vertigo effect. The initial zoom is 1.0x and the final zoom is 2.0x. Start with the camera closer to the object, press the record button, and slowly move the phone further away from the object. Also try recording videos with different durations (ranges from 1-5 seconds)

The recorded video will be saved to your camera roll.

Known Issues:
- If Photo Library Permission is denied the recorded video will be discarded
