- Progress of the recording 0-100%
    + Place on the bottom
    + Progress bar on the push/pull indicator?
    + Progress bar some place else?

# Bugs

- address TODO in code
    + Error handling
- If the device is auto focusing, recording doesn't start. if it's in the process of focusing should give some visual feedback
    + Only provide feedback if it's in states leading to recording

# Future Goals / Ideas

- post processing video for effect
- Automatic zoom adjustment based object tracking / phone movement
- Zoom Adjustment?
    + Given anything beyond 2x zoom looks crappy should this even be allowed?
